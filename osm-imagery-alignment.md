## Fix imagery alignment for OSM editing
_**note:** before aligning based on Bing (or some other imagery layer) check for uploaded GPX data, and if enough GPX data exists, use it to align the imagery for tracing_

------------

### Adjust imagery alignment in iD editor

- from 'Background settings' turn on the imagery layer that will be used for alignment
- trace a few distinct features if there is not enough existing data that can be used as reference features
- switch to the imagery layer that will be used for tracing
- from 'Background settings' go to 'Fix alignment' and use the arrows to move the imagery until it lines up with the reference features
- continue tracing
- save often and have fun!

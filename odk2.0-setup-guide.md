## ODK 2.0

There are five mobile tools used to create customizable mobile data management applications. The five ODK mobile ‘apps’ that comprise the framework are Services, Survey, Tables, Scan, Sensors, and Submit.

There are currently two options for Cloud Endpoints to communicate with ODK 2 tools (Mobile and Desktop Apps).

1. [ODK Sync Endpoints](http://opendatakit-dev.cs.washington.edu/2_0_tools/release/218/cloud_endpoints#1-Sync-Endpoint) - Supports the full ODK 2.0 REST Protocol
2. [ODK Aggregate 1.4.15 Tables Extension](http://opendatakit-dev.cs.washington.edu/2_0_tools/release/218/cloud_endpoints#2-Aggregate) - Supports the majority of the ODK 2.0 REST Protocol; however, is missing group permission filtering support.
